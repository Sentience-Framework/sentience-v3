# Database

Sentience offers its own Database class. It uses PDO to communicate with the database.

## 1. Supported databases

Sentience offsers the following databases:
1. MySQL
2. Postgres
3. SQLite

If you wish to add support for a new database, create a new dialect in the `src/database/dialects` folder, and add the PDO driver name to the match statement in the `DialectFactory`.

## 2. Executing queries

The Database class offers two methods to execute queries.
```
Database::unsafe(query: $query);
Database::safe(query: $query, params: [...$values]);
```

The `unsafe` method is only recommended for queries that do not hold any input data, such as create, drop, or alter queries.

The `safe` methods changes modifies the params depending on which Dialect is currently active. This will translate DateTime and booleans to their correct format.

## 3. Transactions

The Database class offers the following methods for transactions:
```
Databse::beginTransaction();
Databse::commitTransaction();
Databse::rollbackTransaction();
Databse::transactionInCallback(function (Database $database): void {
    ...
});
```

## 4. Queries

- Select
- Insert
- Update
- Delete
- Create table
- Alter table
- Drop table

### 4.8 Universal methods

Each query class has the following methods:
```

Query::tryCatch();  // Returns a Results object, but allows you to catch the exception using a callback
Query::toRawQuery();  // Return query with values instead of placeholders
```

### 4.9 Dot notation references

Instead of using namespace.table.column, and losing out on escaped column names, you can use arrays.
```
['public', 'migrations', 'id']
```

Translates to:
```
"public"."migrations"."id'
```

The use of Raw objects is also permitted in array.
```
['public', Query::raw('migrations'), 'id']
```

Translates to:
```
"public".migrations."id'
```

## 5. Query helper methods

The Query class offers several helper methods:
```
Query::raw()                // Returns a Raw object

Query::escapeLikeChars()    // Escapes characters for like queries
Query::wildcard()           // Useful for quick like queries
Query::now()                // Emulates the widely known 'now()' function
```
